<h1>A short, woefully-incomplete list of the accomplishments of Herbert Hoover</h1>

<blockquote>
  "There is little importance to men's lives except the accomplishments they leave to posterity. When all is said and
  done, record of accomplishments is all that counts." —Herbert Hoover, 1916 [Whyte (2017), p. 176]
